# Changelog

All notable changes to Library Manager will be documented in this file.

## [0.9.0-beta.22] - 2025-12-13

### Added
- **Audio Analysis (Beta)** - Extract metadata from audiobook intros using Gemini
  - Sends 90-second audio sample to Gemini 2.5 Flash for author/title/narrator extraction

## [0.9.0-beta.21] - 2025-12-13

### Fixed
- **Author mismatch rejection** - BookDB now rejects matches where:
  - Title is similar but NOT exact (e.g., "Lost Realms" vs "The Lost Realm")
  - AND author is completely different (e.g., "Thomas Williams" vs "J. D. Rinehart")
  - This prevents wrong book matches that share similar titles

---
